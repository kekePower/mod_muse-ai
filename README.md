## What is mod_muse-ai?

Imagine if your web server could think, create, and respond intelligently to every request. That's exactly what mod_muse-ai does – it's an Apache module that brings artificial intelligence directly into your web server, making it possible to generate dynamic, personalized content on-the-fly.

Instead of serving static HTML files, your Apache server can now:
- **Create unique content** for every visitor based on their needs
- **Generate entire web pages** from simple text prompts
- **Work with ANY OpenAI/Ollama compatible AI service** – cloud or local
- **Respond to natural language queries** with rich, formatted content
- **Adapt content in real-time** without any backend complexity

## Why mod_muse-ai?

### 🎯 **Simplicity Meets Power**
No complex backend infrastructure, no additional servers to manage. Just drop an `.ai` file in your web directory with a simple prompt like "Create a product page for eco-friendly water bottles" and watch your server generate a complete, professional webpage.

### 🌍 **Universal AI Compatibility**
Works with **ANY OpenAI API or Ollama API compatible service** – OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, local Ollama models, or any custom AI service that speaks the same language. One module, unlimited AI possibilities. Switch between providers instantly without changing your code.
